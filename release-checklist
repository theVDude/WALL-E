Pre-release checklist:
 * Update .po files (rake updatepo). Remember to add any new po(t) files.

Release checklist:

 * git push, with tags
 * upload packages to website's download folder
 * update milestones and versions on the website
 * prepare announcement on the website (use the changelog prepared before)
 * change the website front page
 * update the IRC topic
 * [jsn] upload the gem (gem push rbot-<version>.gem)
 * [jsn] update release info on rubyforge (needs release notes and changelog, take from announcement)
 * [jsn] update release info on freshmeat (needs changes summary, see above)
 * write a journal entry on ohloh.net about #rbot <version> being released
